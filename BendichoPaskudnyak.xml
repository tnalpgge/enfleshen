  <personality-traits>
    I am always calm, no matter what the situation.  I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.
    The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable -- or where such things could be hidden.
  </personality-traits>

    People: I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care.

  <bonds>
    Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made.  That will never happen again.

  <flaws>

  <backstory>Been stealin' things long as I can remember.  Started with chickens in my farming town out in the sticks when I was a young'n.  Never kept 'em, just wanted to know if I could 'r not.  Never was much use on the farm anyway.  Ventured the Big City (hah!) in my teens to see if I could make an honest somethin' of my self.  That din't work out neither.  Still managed to keep my nose clean, mostly.  Picked a pocket I prob'ly shouldn't'a, but least it wasn't a law man -- very much the opposite.  Found someone who recognized my, er, unique talents and invited me to join the, er, organization.  Was pretty good for a year or so, ran outta challenges though.  Left there too.  Guess you could say I'm between jobs now?

  What's that in yer pocket, hm?</backstory>
